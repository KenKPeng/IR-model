# IR-model

This project serve as the Supplementary Information of the "Bayesian inference of the impulse-response model of athlete training and performance"

There are two folders "Code" and "material"

The Code folder contains three files:
- "Bayesian IR model.R" implements the Bayesian approach of the Banister IR model
- "Nonlinear least square and MLE methods.R" provides traditional methods to fit the Banister IR model
- "Predictive interval simulation" provides the procedure to simulate the Bayesian predictive interval of the athlete's performance

The material folder contains three files:
- BC_data.xlsx is the data used in the paper
- BC_sample_TRIMPi_2018.csv is the MCMC results described in the Results section of the paper
- 20220210-IRLiteratureParameterCollection is the literature review described in section 2.5 Prior elicitation of the paper
